## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
    Favourite App features:
    - iMessage: while iMessage now allows you to delete your message within a few minutes of
        sending the message, my favourite feature is the fact that even after sending the   
        message, you can edit the sent message in case you had a spelling error instead of  
        deleting it. 
    - IOS Photos app: one feature I find very handy is that if you take a picture of an object   
        like a coffee mug, or just of a person, you can select the object out of the picture and   
        save it as a separate PNG. 
    - Transit app: transit is an app used at the University of Maryland, College Park that allows
        users to track bus routes and it gives real time locations on the bus. My favourite app 
        feature is the fact that once you hop onto your bus, you can provide other people with real 
        time information. For example, you can improve the accuracy of the app by letting it know if 
        you reached your destination in the amount of time the app specified. You can let other people 
        know how crowded the bus is, or if its a little late on its route, and the more helpful you 
        are as a passenger, the more points the app rewards you with.

## Notes

-I think the main challenge was getting used to swift concepts and syntax. Its a very different language and can be complex for new users.  
-Another challenge was being able to implement creative ideas. I only implemented basic features because I wasn't sure what the expectations were for this assignment.
